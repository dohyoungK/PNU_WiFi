classdef (Abstract) hPHYRxInterface < handle
%hPHYRxInterface Define WLAN physical layer Receiver interface
%class
%   The class acts as a base class for all the physical layer types. It
%   defines the interface to physical layer at Receiving side. It
%   declares the properties and methods to be used by higher layers to
%   interact with the physical layer.

    %NodeID Node ID of the receiving WLAN device
    %   Specify the node ID as a scalar integer value greater than 0.

    %EDThreshold Energy detection threshold in dBm
    %   Specify the ED threshold as a scalar negative value. It is used
    %   as a threshold for the received signal power in order to start
    %   decoding the signal and indicate CCABUSY to MAC layer. The
    %   default value is -82 dBm.

    %RxGain receiver gain in dB
    %   Specify the receiver gain as a scalar double value. It is used in
    %   applying the receiver gain on the power of the received WLAN
    %   signal. The default value is 0 dB.

methods (Abstract)
    %run physical layer receive operations for a WLAN node and returns the
    %next invoke time, indication to MAC, and decoded data bits along with
    %the decoded data length
    %
    %   [NEXTINVOKETIME, INDICATIONTOMAC, FRAMETOMAC] = run(OBJ,
    %   ELAPSEDTIME, WLANRXSIGNAL) receives and processes the waveform
    %
    %   NEXTINVOKETIME is the next event time, when this method must be
    %   invoked again.
    %
    %   INDICATIONTOMAC is an output structure to be passed to MAC layer
    %   with the Rx indication (CCAIdle/CCABusy/RxStart/RxEnd/RxErr). This
    %   output structure is valid only when its property IsEmpty is set to
    %   false.
    %
    %   FRAMETOMAC is an output structure to be passed to MAC layer. This
    %   output structure is valid only when its property IsEmpty is set to
    %   false. The type of this structure corresponds to EmptyFrame
    %   property of this object.
    %
    %   ELAPSEDTIME is the time elapsed since the previous call to this.
    %
    %   WLANSIGNAL is an input structure which contains the WLAN
    %   signal received from the channel. This is a valid signal when
    %   the property IsEmpty is set to false in the structure.
    [nextInvokeTime, indicationToMAC, frameToMAC] = run(obj, elapsedTime, wlanSignal)
    
    %setPHYMode Handle the PHY mode set request from the MAC layer
    %
    %   setPHYMode(OBJ, PHYMODE) handles the PHY mode set request from
    %   the MAC layer.
    %
    %   PHYMODE is an input structure from MAC layer to configure the
    %   PHY Rx mode.
